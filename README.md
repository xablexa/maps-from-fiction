## Data Repository for Castles, Battlefields, and Continents: A Dataset of Maps from Literature

The final dataset download includes:
- 2622 identified maps
- csv file of map filenames
- csv file of MARC record data for each map-novel (with annotations for map fictionality and scale)
- finetuned EfficientNet models (b0, b7, and V2_L)
This dataset can be downloaded at XXXXXX

Relevant code will be uploaded to this repository soon. In the meantime, email Axel at adb333 [at] cornell.edu for code or for any questions about the paper.

*Note*: Two maps have been included in this dataset, but should be excluded: 32000002642652_00000033.jpg and 39015030849908_00000219.jpg
These maps contain cartoons with a map in them, one of the edge cases we chose to exclude.
